1) Please make sure that the maximum number of variable shoudn't exceed 10 and is a positive number only.

2) While entering coffeciants, enter the next value by pressing enter key.
 Like if you want to input equation 2(x1)+ 3(x2) + 4(x3) = d
     It will be inputted as
     2 (enter key)
     3 (enter key)
     4 (enter key)
     d (enter key) Then the code will print the formed array from this input.

3) The code works well in finding whether the solution exists for the given set of linear equation or not( infinity or no-soln case)

4) Logic for 3rd point is that, whenever a dia element is 0, it checks for the RHS of the equation i.e. for the (d part*). If RHS is zero,
   then there will be infinitely many solution else no solution exist for the equation.(Intresting!)
   (Arise at this conclusion after analysing the trends from every failed case)

5) Trivial case is handled seperately. In Trivial case Det=0 and rhs of each equation(i.e. d* ) is zero. Solution x1=x1=x3* =0 only, exists for the given equation.

6) Rest, I have tried commenting the important steps for better understanding.

7) Logic for exceptional cases like of inf and no solution is same in both ques.

8) If code is not working in the above mentioned way, there can be a small typo error that've crept in. Please inform me via mail before grading zero.

*= refer 2nd point for reference to d and no. of var used.
Hope you'll love the code.
Thank You
